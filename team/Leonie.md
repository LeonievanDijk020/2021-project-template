I'm Leonie, I live in the north of Amsterdam and I work for the University of Applied Sciences. I'm working on the CCDL project together with Frank, Maaike and Laurens. Besides the work I do at the Universitiy, I have my own podcast about psychology together with a friend (unfortunately it's in Dutch!).

- What made you choose this project?
I feel like we can use data in a more optimistic manner, now that lots of data is used in a bad way. I also think that sharing and visualising data can help understand each other and the world around us better.
