During the pandemic, when we were all of a sudden in a lockdown, the gyms closed their doors as well. Of course this was necessary and also, we didn't know much about the virus when it all hit us. For most people, as for myself, it was hard to all of a sudden quit all physical excercise. Gyms needed to be extra creative, and after weeks of online lessons via Zoom and people installing their very own home gyms, a little more was possible and some gyms could host their lessons again in small groups in the parks and on squares of Amsterdam. 
My (kick) boxing school in the North of Amsterdam, named Boogieland, took it to another level. They started the 'Boogieland Foundation', to make (kick)boxing available for everybody in the city. They raised money to buy the [Boogieland boxing bags](http://boogieland.nl/boxingbags/) and installed them all throughout the city. On Soundcloud they made their trainers record workouts with boxing combinations (for free obviously), so that everybody who wanted could have a proper (kick)boxing workout. Even in the second lockdown, people could still have their workout and stay healthy.
